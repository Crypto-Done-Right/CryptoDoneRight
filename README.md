# Welcome to CryptoDoneRight!

The project is dependent on git and ruby being pre-installed.

## To build and run the project:

    1. 'git clone https://github.com/jhu-information-security-institute/CryptoDoneRight.git` (this clones the main project. If you are hoping to contribute, please fork the project and clone your personal fork)
    2. `cd CryptoDoneRight`
    3. `gem install bundler`
    4. `bundle install`
    5. `bundle exec jekyll serve -l`
    6. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:4000 in a browser

## Things that can go wrong.

    - Error: "cannot find gem bundler", Possible Fix: `update gem --system`
    - Error: "can't find header files for ruby", Possible Fix: Install Ruby dev. On Ubuntu, `apt install ruby-dev`

## We welcome contributions!

More information in the CONTRIBUTING-template.md, but to be sure you don't have to duplicate your changes, fork the project and make changes to your own branches. From there, you can open a pull request as the contributing guide describes.
