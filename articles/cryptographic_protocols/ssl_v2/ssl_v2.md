  - name: DROWN Vulnerability
    description: ": DROWN (Decrypting RSA using Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption) allows attackers to break the encryption and read or steal sensitive communications,

  - name: Ciphersuite RollBack Attack
    description: ": An attacker is able to modify the SSL Handshake to force the connection to use weaker cipher suites than what the client has proposed.
    SSLv2 has a lot of weak encryption ciphers available. It is not uncommon to find weak encryption settings enabled on a server. One such weak encryption algorithm is named DES."

SSL 2.0 was officially the first SSL version available (SSLv1 never got released). It was released in February 1995.
A lot of weaknesses in the protocol led to the development of SSLv3.0. A lot of modern systems do not support SSL2.0 so supporting it for whatever reason would be a major security concern and is simply not recommended.
