<font size="4"><strong>Concept:</strong></font>  DO NOT roll your own Crypto! Use standard services and libraries. <br />
It is NOT advisable in any circumstances to develop any sort of cryptography on your own. Instead , there are a few options for standard libraries that can be used.
These libraries offer better stability as they are usually a product of several years of experience in implementing cryptography by an active development community who are
dedicated towards efforts in implementation. It is therefore considered to be reliable and robust. <br /> <br />
<font size="3"><strong>Examples:</strong></font>
Openssl is one such library which popular and therefore is used as an example for this concept.
OpenSSL is not the only available crypto library. For a list of different libraries and a comparision
between them, visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cryptography_libraries">here</a>.
<br /> <br />
Find out which openssl version you are using: <br /> <br />
Use the version option. <br />
<pre>
  <code>
$ openssl version
OpenSSL 1.0.1e-fips 11 Feb 2013
</code>
</pre>
<br />
You can get much more information with the version -a option. <br />
<pre>
  <code>

<span class="red">Please note that OpenSSL 1.0.2k has removed 3DES support. There are still ways you can re-enable 3DES (<a href="https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2016/08/24/sweet32/">Re-enable 3DES</a>), but considering the security implications, this should be done only if absolutely necessary. </span>

<h2>Usage of Cryptography in Programming Languages</h2>
<font size="4"><strong>Concept:</strong></font> It is again advised to not roll out your own cryptography while developing software. There are popular libraries in almost all programming
languages that can readily be used to perform cryptographic operations.
<br /> <br />
<font size="4"><strong>Examples:</strong></font> <br />
<strong>C/C++: </strong> <br />
There are multiple options for libraries that support 3DES in C/C++.  <br /> <br />
