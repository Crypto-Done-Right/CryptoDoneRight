  <h2> <img src="/static_files/common/configuration.jpg " style="width:110px;height:100px;" /> AES CTR Mode </h2>

<strong>Why CTR Mode:</strong> <br />
Considered a safe and efficient method of operation. Both CBC and CTR come recommended by Niels Ferguson and Bruce Schneier, both of whom are respected cryptographers. <br />

<strong>How it works:</strong><br />
This essentially involves encrypting a sequence of incrementing numbers prefixed with a nonce (number used once) to produce a keystream, and again is a stream cipher mode. <br /> <br />

<strong>Where is it commonly used:</strong><br />
CTR is used in many of the SSL/TLS cipher suites. <br /> <br />

<strong>How to use CTR: </strong>
<ul>
<li>aes-128-ctr ← this is okay</li>
<li>aes-192-ctr</li>
<li>aes-256-ctr ← this is recommended</li>
</ul>

<br />
CTR mode is widely accepted and any problems are considered a weakness of the underlying block cipher, which is expected to be secure regardless of systemic bias in its input. <br /><br />

<strong>How secure?</strong> <br /> <br />
<span class="red">CTR requires no padding </span> <br /> <br />
CTR mode is special in a few ways: <br /><br />

<ul>
<li> Padding doesn't apply and therefore eliminates all the padding attacks that were possible with modes like CCB where padding is required. . Normally, a block encryption algorithm (AES, Blowfish, DES, RC2, etc.) emit encrypted output that is a multiple of the block size (16 bytes for AES as an example). With CTR mode, the number of bytes output is exactly equal to the number of bytes input, so no padding/unpadding is required. The PaddingScheme property does not apply for counter mode.</li>

<li>CTR mode increments a counter for each subsequent block encrypted. For example, if an application encrypted the string "1234567890" twenty times in a row, using the same instance of the Chilkat Crypt2 object, then each iteration's result would be different. This is because the counter is being incremented. The decrypting application would need to decrypt in exactly the same manner. The 1st decrypt should begin with a new instance of a Crypt2 object so that it's counter is at the initial value of 0.</li>

</ul>

<br />
It would be a mistake to encrypt 20 strings using an instance of the Crypt2 object, and then attempt to decrypt with the same Crypt2 object. To decrypt successfully, the app would need to instantiate a new Crypt2 object and then decrypt, so that the counters match. <br /> <br />

<span class="green">Good points:</span>  Secure when done right, parallel encryption and decryption. <br />
<span class="red">Bad points:</span>  Not many. Some question the security of the "related plaintext" model but it's generally considered to be safe.

<font size="4"><strong>Concept:</strong></font>  DO NOT roll your own Crypto! Use standard services and libraries. <br />

It is NOT advisable in any circumstances to develop any sort of cryptography on your own. Instead , there are a few options for standard libraries that can be used.
These libraries offer better stability as they are usually a product of several years of experience in implementing cryptography by an active development community who are
dedicated towards efforts in implementation. It is therefore considered to be reliable and robust. <br /> <br />


<font size="3"><strong>Examples:</strong></font>
Openssl is one such library which popular and therefore is used as an example for this concept.
OpenSSL is not the only available crypto library. For a list of different libraries and a comparision
between them, visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cryptography_libraries">here</a>.
<br /> <br />

The recommended version of OpenSSL that is to be used for AES is 1.1.0. This is for various reasons that concern and do not concern with AES. Some of them include for the latest encryption standards and removal of older vulnerable ones.
<br /> <br />

<h2>Usage of Cryptography in Programming Languages</h2>

<font size="4"><strong>Concept:</strong></font> It is again advised to not roll out your own cryptography while developing software. There are popular libraries in almost all programming
languages that can readily be used to perform cryptographic operations.
